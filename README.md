# Type1-Diabetes-Recurrent-Neural-Network

LSTM Recurrent Neural Network created to help predict blood glucose levels within T1Diabetes patients. The code is not included in this repo as it was lost, but the paper as a result of this code is included.

Project was created for AP Research, topic was chosen by me, data was collected and cleaned by me.

Goal of the research was to attempt to cut down on unneeded insulin use, and prevent large swings in blood glucose levels.
Chose to do research on teenage type 1 diabetics, as teenage type 1 diabetics tend to have inconsistent insulin resistance and glucose synthesization due to the presence of hormones from puberty.
